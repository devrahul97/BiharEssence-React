Even a Single line can create a Bug.

Manual Testing
Write code to do the testing: code that will test your code.


3 types of Test that Developer can do

1: Unit Testing
2: Integration Testing  : these 2 are for Developers
3: End 2 End Testing

Testing is part of Developement

Library
1: React Testing Library
2: Jest 


jest internally used Babel
React Testign Library uses Jest Behind the scene.


command:

npm i -D @testing-library/react
npm i -D jest
npm install --save-dev babel-jest @babel/core @babel/preset-env



Setting up Testing in our APP

1: install react testing Library
2: install jest
3: Installed Babel Dependencies.
4: Installed Babel Dependencies.
5. Configure Babel.
6. Configure Parcel config file to disable default babel transpilation.
7: jest Configuration

npm jest --init
command to run test: npm run test

parcel already uses Babel behind the scene and parcel has it's own configuration for Babel.
now we are trying to add extra configuration. So parcel will get confused and it will confused with this configuration.

So we will have to change parcel Behavior to use Babel along with Jest.

=> Parcel uses Babel(transpiler) behind the scene.
