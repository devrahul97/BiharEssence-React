zestand similar to Redux: 

Redux: primarly used for handling state of Applications.
 -> Offers easy debugging.


 Two Library

 1: React Redux
 2: Redux Toolkit: is a newer way of writing Redux.

 Redux tool kit : RTK.

 Redux Store is a kind of very Big JavaScript Object with a lot of Data inside it. 


Question: Is it a good  practice to keep all the inside it ??

    Yes, it is absolutely fine.


    Slices:  prats of Redux Store is known as Slices.

    To keep data Seperate we make logical Seperations that is called Slices.

    Example:

        Cart data in seperate Slice
        LoggedIn data in Seperste Slice
        user Slice
        Theme Slice

        Intially, Slice can be empty.



        Dispatch an Action: 

        -> When you click on the Add Button => it will dispatch an Action => Action will call a Function() => Function will modify the Cart.(Slice of the Redux Store)

        FUnction is Known as Reducer function.

        We have Seen How to Write Data.

        ======================== Now we will See How to read Data ===================
        it means How we will read the Data from Derux Slice and Update it into the Cart.

      For that we will use something known as Selector.

    So What will Happen is: 

    We will use the "Selector" to read the Data from Store and Selector will modify our React Component.

   This Phenomena is known as Subscribing to the Store.



=> Header COmponent is Subscribe to our Store, it means basically it is in Sync with the Store.
If the Data inside my store changes my Header Component will update Automagically.
 
 => Subscribing to the Store, using "Seletor".


 ========== 45: 00 min ===========


 =======================    Reducer vs Reducers   ====================

 when you are creating a App Store.. here the keyword is reducer, because this is one big reducer.
 And it can have multiple small Reducers.


 But when we are writing slices we create multiple reducers 



Redux is creating immutable State.

Behind the Scene Redux uses "immer" Library.

Debugging tools for Redux: Redux dev tools.


RTK Query: Redux Thunk, Middleware now We have RTK Query.


React Testing Library uses Jest behind the scene.
