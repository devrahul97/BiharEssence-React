We can write react without jSX
React is seperate
JSX is seperate
Lots of developer think that both are same thing, No

-> JSX is different than Html

JSX is a Html like Syntax.


Question ??

-> Do we write code for machine of Humans ??
1st for humans then for machines


transpiled the code before it goes to js engine.

transpiled -> convert  the code that browser can understand.

Transpiling is done by parsel -> Babel package transpile.

babel -> it takes your jsx and it converts it to the code that js engine understands

Read about Babel

=========================  JSX ========================

If you write curly braces inside JSX, you can run any piece of js expression.
JSX is mix of html and javascript.

jsx takes care of injection attack.
it snitizes everything.



cross site scripting -> it can steal cookies, read local storage, session storage, get information about your laptop.
injection attack


================= These three things are same things==================
{Title()}
{<Title/>}
{<Title></Title>}

 
Notes:
-----

// React.CreateElement => JS Object => Render to dom=> it becomes html element(HTMl element)


// React component, 2 types of components
// 1: Class Based component - OLD -> Uses javascript classes
// 2: Functional Component  - NEW -> Uses Javascript Functions

// React Functional Component -> it is just a Javascript functions
// when you are creating any functional component name starts with capital letter otherwise you will get error
// A functional Component is a Normal JS funtions which return some  jsx Element/code
// A function which is returning some jsx is a functional component.

// you won't find lot of people writing return 

// what is the difference between react element and react Component


// JSX (transpiled before it reaches the JS) - PARCEL - Babel
// JSX => babel transpiles it to React.CreateElement => React Element Object => Render to dom=> it becomes html element (HTMl element)


// what is component conpositions ??
// putting one components inside another.
