 config Driven UI. Swiggy, zomatto, Paytm

-> Everything that react can do, you can do it using Normal -> Html, Js and Css.
Then  why React ??

-> Any framework out there whatever you can do, you can do it using -> Html, Js and Css..
At the End of the Day -> React is also  using Javascript behind the scene

The Beauty of using a framework or a Library is : it makes developer Experience easy.
it makes you write less code and do more on the web page.
This is the major job of Framework or a Library

==Best Practice

-> Seperate files for Seperate components

folder Structure

Google these topics and read:

1:  react file structure and read

components
    Header.jsx
    Header.js
    Header.tsx 

    which is good ?? any one js or jsx
    it will make 0 difference.


Export component and import component

-> whenever you have mocked data/ Hard coded data, you should never keep it in your componet file.
This is industry standard, best practice.

keep it inside a Seperate file. Keep it inside Utils folder -> constants.js

-> Keep your Constant in Capital Letter Snake Case.


================  export imports ==================

2 types
-------

   1. default export/import -> 
   2. named export/import  -> is used when in a Single file you have to export multiple things. while import use {} brackets


        example -> constants.js for export and RestaurantCard for import
        e.g.. export const LOGO_URL = "" ;

-> you can also export your component using named export 


2 Types of Export/Import 
------------------------

    -> Default Export /Import

        export default Component
        import Component from "path";

    -> Named Export/Import

        export const Component
        import {Component} from "path";

--> When you have to export multiple things ===>  use Named export.

Question Home work : Can I use default export along with Named Export ??

component file sshould not exceed more than 100 lines
keep you component small and lcean


========50:: minute ========Make Our App Dynamic==============
-> top rated Restaurants feature
-> Even Handler 

-> when you have a react App, you have 2 Layer
    1: UI Layer   -> will display what is being sent by Data Layer.
    2: Data Layer

   -------- Event Handler ---------
   onMouseOver() = {}
   onClick() = {}

================ React Super power ==================
    -> React is fast in DOM Manipulation.

    suppose you have to keep your data Layer and UI layer consistent whith each other that is where react comes into picture.
    And all the other frameworks.. Angular, React, Vue is trying to solve this, that UI Layer and Data Layer should work with each other in Sync.
    if my Data Changes my UI changes.

    --Why React is Fast ?--
        Because:
        1: It can do faster DOM Manipulation
        2: It can do Efficient DOM Manipulation
        3: Virtual DOM
        4: Diff Algorith
        5: Reconciliation.





================  React Hooks ================

Super powerfull variable, state variable

what is functional Component ? -> it is a Noraml javascript Function.
what is React Element  ? -> it is a plane Javascript Object.

--> Similarly, Hooks is a Normal Javascript Utility function.

 -2 important Hooks

1: useState(): 80% times you will be using this --> Superpowerfull State Variables in React
2: useEffect(): 20% times you will be using this

-> import this as a Named import, for that you need to use : import {useState } from "react";

it is used to create State Variable
why we call it as State Variiable ??
--> Because it maintains the state of your component.

ex: const [listOfRestaurants] = usestate([]);

useState() : This keeps the UI Layer in Sync with the Data Layer.

As soon as the state variable updates/changes it will automatically refresh our components: THis is known as Render.

==> whenever state variable updates/changes react re-renders the component

==> React is only Good at DOM Operations/Manipulations
